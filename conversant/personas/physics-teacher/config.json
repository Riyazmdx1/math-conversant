For the ground state (n=1), the energy is: E_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV For the unbound state (n=∞), the energy is: E_∞ = -13.6 eV / ∞^2 = 0 eV The energy required to ionize the hydrogen atom is the difference between these two energy levels: ΔE = E_∞ - E_1 = 0 eV - (-13.6 eV) = 13.6 eV So, the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state to an unbound state is 13.6 electron volts (eV)."
